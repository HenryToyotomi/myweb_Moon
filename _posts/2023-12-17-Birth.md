It is 23:22 2023/12/17 right now, in my dorm in Sheffield, UK. As a PhD student in engineering, I should be doing something about mad technology or playing computer games now. Editting my webpage, seems good. 

Recently, my mind sometimes flashed back to last year when I was an engineer in a company in China, where I Finished work at late night and walked while watching the moon. 'Where I am and why should I be busy like this?', asked myself. 

Luckily, I am here right now, shower-washed, wearing my slippers, and an Internet-connected computer. Last five years, challenges have really challenged everybody and me. From university-life isolation, Covid-19, breakups, to killing workload and family objection for my choice, everything of these had tried pretty hard to test my beleif & tenacity. Now when I look back, I found that I learned nothing, but becoming a chill & existential guy.                            

Fortunately, my 'families', my friends, and my soul saved me. Hopefully, if god exists, he/she/it/they must also helped and will help a lot. Cheers mate. You are now in your golden age, together with everyone around you with love and math.
